At 2.4 million light years away, uncountably many new stars are being birthed in its spiral arms. These young, massive stars shine blue, and they excite the molecules in interstellar gas to shine a red-violet. In the yellow-white background lie billions of Sun-like stars -- the darker areas arise from dust clouds blocking these stars' light. This photograph was taken by the widefield camera of the Wendelstein Observatory's 2m Fraunhofer Telescope, and has an angular diameter close to that of the Moon."

The nebula's distinctive shape is made up of reddish gas and brown dust. Young, hot stars from the center heat the surrounding gas to about 10,000 degrees Celsius, causing it to produce its own light. The red color seen in the Nebula comes from the H-alpha emission line of hydrogen atoms in the Nebula's water molecules, making up over 70% of the nebula by mass. This image is about as wide in the sky as the Moon, and, at the distance the Orion Nebula sits, crosses about 12 light years.

      "desc": "The Whirlpool Galaxy consists of two: the spiral galaxy NGC 5194 (below, with similar structure and size to our Milky Way) and its clearly smaller companion, NGC 5195 (above). NGC 5195 is in an elliptical, inward-spiraling orbit around NGC 5194, which, in about 100 million years, will lead to a collision between the two galaxies. Already the strong tidal forces between the two galaxies have flung millions of stars into intergalactic space, forming diffuse filaments and asymmetric structure, especially around NGC5195. Messier 51 is about 26 million light years from Earth, meaning the actual gap between the galaxies is about 35,000 light years. The Wendelstein Observatory's 2m Fraunhofer Telescope took the photograph in three different colors -- blue, red, and infrared -- which were later superimposed to produce the above image."

M65 resembles our Milky Way galaxy, and both galaxies contain about 100 billion stars each. Both galaxies have diameters of about 100,000 light years. The blue light seen in both galaxies comes from young, massive stars, up to a hundred times the mass of our Sun, while the yellow light comes from stars much like the Sun. The dark filaments, however, are from interstellar dust. The many pointlike objects in the foreground are from stars within the Milky Way galaxy, while the dim, wider objects in the background are entire galaxies, much further away. The intergalactic space between M65 and M66 is almost devoid of stars.

The center of the cluster (slightly above the center of the image) is dominated by elliptical galaxies, which glow yellow, containung up to a trillion Sun-like stars. Some of these galaxies are actively merging with each other. A spiral galaxy resembling the Milky Way can be seen underneath the center, which has a diameter of about 50,000 light years. The bright, white stars in the foreground belong to the Milky Way, while the dim, reddish objects are mostly galaxies much further away -- some up to ten billion light years away. This picture is about as wide as the Moon, matching the Abell 262 cluster's 2 million light year distance.

Large elliptical galaxies, glowing in white-yellow light and containing up to a trillion Sun-like stars, dominate the Cluster's center. Spiral galaxies like our Milky Way can hardly withstand the strong tidal forces of so many stars. If we put the Milky Way in the Perseus Cluster, it would be about the size of and look similar to the blueish spiral galaxies up and to the left of the middle of the image. The many pointlike objects dotting the entire picture are mostly stars in our Milky Way, but some are galaxies up to 10 billion light years away. This image is about as wide in the sky as the Moon, which, at the distance the Perseus Galactic Cluster sits, crosses about 2 million light years.
